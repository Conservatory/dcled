#   The Conservatory (https://conservatory.github.io/) is a place where      #
#   free software that has no other public version-controlled home on the    #
#   Internet is made available in a git repository.  For dcled, we did the   #
#   usual treatment: each upstream release package is committed as one git   #
#   revision, starting from dcled-1.0.  Note that for some reason dcled-1.3  #
#   was absent from upstream's archive (though the 404 error page for it     #
#   rocks -- try https://www.last-outpost.com/~malakai/dcled/dcled-1.3.tgz   #

dcled - userland driver for Dream Cheeky (Dream Link?) USB LED Message Board

Copyright 2009 Jeff Jahr <malakais@pacbell.net> 

This is free software.  G'head, use it all you want.  

Version 1.0 took ~12 hours to write, and was my first foray into usb device
programming.  This is probably not a real good example of how to do ANYTHING.
Sun Jan  4 00:18:41 PST 2009 -jsj

Dcled runs on linx.  To use it, you need to have the usb hiddev loaded- on my
system that seems to be the module named 'usbhid', and it is loaded by default.
When you plug in the message board, the system ought to see it and create an
entry in /dev/usb/hiddev* for it.  You can check if the device is loaded
correctly with this command:

lsusb -d 1d34:0013 -v

That out to output a whole lot of stuff that you probably dont care about-
unless it outputs nothing.  If it outputs nothing, then you have a problem with
your usb. Or maybe you have message board with a different vendor and product
id.

BUILDING IT:

Type make.  That should make an executable called 'dcled'.  If that doesnt
work, try compling it by hand.

RUNNING IT:

Usage- ./dcled [opts] [files]
        --brightness,-b - how bright, 0-2
        --debug,-d      - mostly useless
        --echo,-e       - send copy to stdout
        --help,-h       - duh
        --message,-m    - a single line to scroll
        --outdev,-o     - specifiy the exact path to the hiddev
        --repeat,-r     - keep scrolling forever
        --speed,-s      - ms to delay
        --test,-t       - output a test pattern

I set it up so that it works like cat.  If you run dcled with a list of files,
it will cat each of those files to the message board.  If you dont name any
files at all, dcled reads from stdin, so that you can use it as a pipe.  There
is also the --message="" option in case you want to send a single line to it.

EXAMPLES:

Run a test pattern:
dcled -t  

Hello World:
dcled -m 'Hello World!'

Hello World part 2:
echo 'Hello World!' | dcled

Hell World part 3:
echo Hello >f1
echo Hello >f2
dcled f1 f2


CREDITS:

I used the docs written by Alvin Wong of Dream Link to get the device protocol
right.  Way to go with releasing hardware specs!  Awesome!

I took the font data from pictures of the X11 "5x7" font.  Its a long story.
